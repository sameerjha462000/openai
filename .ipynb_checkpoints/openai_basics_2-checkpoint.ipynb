One day, after months of flirting, John finally asked Ellie out. She, of course, said yes and the two went on their first date. They talked about everything under the sun--from their favorite books to their aspirations. Before they knew it, the sun was setting, and they still had not said goodbye.  That night, they couldn't help but feel like something profound had changed between them. From that night on, they were inseparable.  Unfortunately, their relationship was abruptly cut short when John had to travel abroad for work. They kept in touch for a while, but eventually, they drifted apart.
